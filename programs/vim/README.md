# Syntax Highlighting

* You can see what scripts vim has loaded with `:scriptnames`. This was useful
    to understand where the syntax highlighting was coming from
* `:hi` is the Ex command that can do highlighting things
* Use links to existing styles to handle changing the color schemes
* you've got one started at ~/cs.vim
* you should probably think about getting fresh setup for the directories
    underneath .vim
